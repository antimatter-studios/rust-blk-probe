//! The stable-toolchain half of the fuzzing setup: replay the corpus, then
//! mutate it, and refuse if the probe panics, hangs, or if the suite quietly
//! stopped doing any work.
//!
//! # Why there are two halves
//!
//! `fuzz/` holds `cargo-fuzz` targets. Those are the explorer: they run for as
//! long as you give them and find inputs nobody thought of. They cannot be a
//! required check, because how long they ran decides what they found, and a
//! fresh discovery would fail whichever unrelated pull request happened to be
//! open.
//!
//! This suite is the gate. Deterministic, on the stable toolchain, in every
//! pull request, reading the same `fuzz/corpus/` the explorer does. Anything
//! the explorer finds is committed there and replayed here from then on --
//! that is the whole reason the two tiers share one corpus directory.
//!
//! # Why the corpus is whole disks other tools wrote
//!
//! This crate is the first thing to touch an unknown device. It decides what
//! the whole thing is from the magic at offset 0, and whatever it decides
//! sends the bytes to a container reader, a partition walker and a filesystem
//! sniffer in turn. A corpus this crate wrote would only prove it agrees with
//! itself, so the seeds are images `sgdisk`, `sfdisk`, `mkfs.ext4`,
//! `mksquashfs` and `qemu-img` produced, built by
//! `scripts/make-fuzz-corpus.sh`.
//!
//! They are also an ORACLE, not just fuel. `every_committed_image_is_read_as
//! _what_the_tool_that_wrote_it_says` holds each one to the container and the
//! table its maker put there, on a machine with none of those tools
//! installed. Without it a seed that stopped probing would go on being
//! mutated and go on not failing -- a mutation of an unreadable image is also
//! unreadable -- and the corpus would still be there, testing nothing.
