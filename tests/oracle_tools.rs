//! What `blkid` and `sfdisk` say about the same bytes.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! Every other test in this crate hands a buffer to this crate's parser and
//! asserts on what this crate's formatter produced. The proposition "this
//! device carries a GPT with two partitions, the first starting at 17408" was
//! asserted by the code that computed it, and a probe that read a start from
//! the wrong offset would agree with itself all the way through (#13).
//!
//! `util-linux` has no stake in our reading of these formats. `blkid` is the
//! reference identifier for "what is on this device" and `sfdisk --dump`
//! prints the table one field at a time, so both can be compared field by
//! field against the document this crate emits.
//!
//! # Where it runs, and what happens when the tools are absent
//!
//! `blkid` and `sfdisk` are util-linux, which is Linux's. The file is
//! therefore compiled only on Linux -- on macOS there is no equivalent to
//! reach for, and a test that quietly returns because a tool is missing reads
//! exactly like a test that passed.
//!
//! On Linux a missing tool **fails**, naming what to install. It does not
//! skip: both are in the base `util-linux` package, present on every GitHub
//! Linux runner, so "absent" means somebody changed the image and the right
//! answer is to say so loudly.
//!
//! XFS, Btrfs and EROFS are compared over images written here, at test time,
//! by `mkfs.xfs`, `mkfs.btrfs` and `mkfs.erofs` -- mkfs.xfs will not write
//! anything small enough to commit. Those are xfsprogs, btrfs-progs and
//! erofs-utils, which CI installs on its Linux legs; a missing one fails the
//! same way, naming its package.
//!
//! The corpus-recorded half of this check runs everywhere, on a machine with
//! neither tool: `every_committed_image_is_read_as_what_the_tool_that_wrote
//! _it_says` in tests/fuzz_decoders.rs holds the same images to what their
//! makers put in them. This file is what keeps those recorded expectations
//! honest.
