# with scripts/package.sh exactly as ci.yml and release.yml do, and holds the
# result to scripts/check-package.sh -- and then proves that check FAILS on a
# tarball with a file too many, a missing LICENSE, a checksum that does not
# match and a platform the binary was not built for. A check that cannot fail
# is indistinguishable from no check.
