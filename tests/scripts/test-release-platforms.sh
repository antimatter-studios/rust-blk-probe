# A release publishes, attests and attaches a tarball for every platform the
# tool ships on -- and every pull request builds each of them first.
#
# v0.1.0 shipped rust-blk-probe-0.1.0-darwin-arm64.tar.gz and nothing else
# (#45), so blk.probe could not be installed on Linux at all, and a tap
# formula had no Linux asset to point at. Nothing noticed: release.yml runs
# only on a tag, and a release with one tarball is exactly as green as one
# with two. This makes the missing platform loud on the pull request that
# drops it.
#
# What is held, parsed as YAML rather than scanned by line:
#
#   release.yml  a job runs scripts/package.sh once for each of PLATFORMS,
#                each on a runner that builds that platform natively; the
#                legs hand their tarballs on with actions/upload-artifact;
#                one job that `needs:` them downloads them, attests the
#                *.tar.gz with actions/attest-build-provenance, and only
#                then attaches the tarballs AND their .sha256 files with
#                `gh release upload`.
#   ci.yml       its packaging job runs scripts/package.sh for each of
#                PLATFORMS on a native runner, so the first build of a
#                platform's tarball is never the tag's.
#
# It proves it fails first, against workflows with a platform dropped, a
# platform built on the wrong runner, and each attestation step removed.
