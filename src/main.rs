//! `blk-probe` — the command-line front of the probe.
//!
//! Everything this program does is in the library beside it: [`probe_path`]
//! opens a disk image (raw, or a qcow2 / VHD / VHDX / VMDK container), walks
//! its partition table and renders the JSON document. This file is argument
//! parsing, the exit-code table, and the decision to write to stdout.
//!
//! THE SPLIT EXISTS SO THE PROBE CAN BE CALLED BY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A
//! SHELL. It was all in here, which meant a `#[cfg(test)]` module inside this
//! binary was the only thing that could reach it -- no fuzz target, no
//! integration test, no comparison against `blkid` over an image built by
//! `mkfs`. This crate decides what every other parser in the family is handed,
//! and it is the one most likely to be pointed at something that is not a disk
//! image at all (#16).
//!
//! Usage:
//!   blk-probe <path>
//!   blk-probe <path> --container=qcow2|vhd|vhdx|vmdk
//!
//! Exit codes:
//!   0  — JSON written to stdout
//!   1  — argument / option error
//!   2  — file open / container layer error
//!   3  — partition probe error: the table could not be read
//!
//! A disk with *no* partition table is not exit 3. That is a normal answer —
//! a whole-device filesystem — and it exits 0 with `"table":"none"`. Exit 3 is
//! the opposite case: a table is there and this program could not read it, so
//! nothing is written to stdout. The JSON shape itself is documented on the
//! library crate.
