//! diskprobe — open a disk image (raw or container), walk its partition
//! table, emit JSON describing what's inside.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   diskprobe <path>
//!   diskprobe <path> --container=qcow2|vhd|vhdx|vmdk
//!
//! When `--container` is omitted, container kind is auto-detected from
//! the magic at offset 0 (or the trailing 512-byte footer for fixed
//! VHDs). If no container is recognised the file is treated as a raw
//! disk image (which is correct for whole-disk `.img` / `.dd` dumps).
//!
//! Exit codes:
//!   0  — JSON written to stdout
//!   1  — argument / option error
//!   2  — file open / container layer error
//!   3  — partition probe error: the table could not be read
//!
//! A disk with *no* partition table is not exit 3. That is a normal answer
//! — a whole-device filesystem — and it exits 0 with `"table":"none"` plus a
//! `device_fs_kind` naming whatever was sniffed at offset 0. Exit 3 is the
//! opposite case: a table is there and this program could not read it (CRC
//! mismatch, truncation, I/O failure), so nothing is written to stdout.
//!
//! A failed *filesystem sniff* is reported in-band instead, because the rest
//! of the document is still true. The partition gets `"fs_kind":"error"` and
//! an `"fs_kind_error"` holding the reason; the whole-device equivalents are
//! `"device_fs_kind"` and `"device_fs_error"`. `"unknown"` therefore means
//! only what it says — the sniff ran and recognised nothing.
//!
//! JSON shape:
//!   {
//!     "path": "/path/to/file",
//!     "container": "qcow2"|"vhd"|"vhdx"|"vmdk"|"raw",
//!     "container_size_bytes": 12345,        // virtual size after container unwrap
