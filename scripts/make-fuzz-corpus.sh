# Rebuild fuzz/corpus/ from images third-party tools wrote.
#
# WHY THE SEEDS ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S IMAGES. This crate decides what an unknown
# device IS, and whatever it decides sends the bytes to some other parser. A
# corpus this crate wrote would only prove it agrees with itself; `sgdisk`,
# `sfdisk`, `mkfs.ext4`, `mksquashfs` and `qemu-img` have no stake in our
# reading of the formats, so a seed that stops probing is evidence about us.
#
# The same images are the oracle in tests/fuzz_decoders.rs: every committed
# file has a row there naming the container and the table the tool that wrote
# it put in it, so a seed cannot quietly stop being a disk and go on being
# mutated -- a mutation of an unprobeable image is also unprobeable, and the
# corpus would still be there, testing nothing.
#
# IMAGES ARE DELIBERATELY SMALL. A GPT needs 33 sectors at either end and
# nothing in between has to be real, so 128 KiB is a whole disk as far as a
# partition table is concerned. The one exception is noted where it is made.

# than at the 1 MiB alignment a real disk would use -- sfdisk refuses a start
# past the end of the image, which is the honest constraint of a disk this
# small. `label-id` is pinned for the same reason the GPT GUIDs are.

# --- the same GPT disk in each container format ---------------------------

# 512-byte footer glued on the end and is therefore the one format whose
# signature is not at the start. Both shapes are here on purpose.

# --- a VHDX, truncated, and why -------------------------------------------
# qemu-img writes 9 MiB for a VHDX of a 128 KiB disk however it is asked: the
# format's log and metadata regions have a floor a small disk does not lower.
# Committing that is out of proportion to what it buys, so what is kept is the
# first 320 KiB -- the file identifier, both headers and both region tables,
# which is every structure a reader parses before it reaches payload.
#
# It is therefore a VHDX THAT CANNOT BE OPENED, and tests/fuzz_decoders.rs
# says so: the expectation on this seed is that the container is recognised
# and the open then fails. That is a real path -- a device that says it is a
# VHDX and is not one is exactly what this crate is pointed at -- and it is
# the header bytes, not the payload, that are worth mutating.

# --- whole-device filesystems, with no partition table at all -------------
# `"table":"none"` is not an error in this crate's contract, it is an answer,
# and it is the answer that reaches the whole-device sniff. Both of these are
# ones `blkid` recognises, so the expectations in the gate are checkable
# against a tool that is not us.
