# Package a built blk_probe as the release tarball.
#
# THE TARBALL IS THE CONTRACT. A consumer downloads it, unpacks it and runs
# bin/blk.probe by that path, so its layout is fixed and checked -- by
# scripts/check-package.sh, which ci.yml runs on every pull request and
# release.yml runs before anything is attested or uploaded:
#
#   bin/blk.probe   the probe, renamed from the cargo target by stage-binary.sh
#   LICENSE
#
# It is named rust-blk-probe-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz, after the
# repository and not the tool, and a <name>.sha256 is written beside it.
#
# The rename is stage-binary.sh's, not a second copy of it here: cargo refuses
# a dot in a target name, and there is one place that knows that.
#
# Usage: scripts/package.sh <built-binary> <version> <platform> <out-dir>
#   e.g. scripts/package.sh target/release/blk_probe 0.1.0 darwin-arm64 dist
